# Public Health Disease Geomapping for Residents of Cavite

Intro:
A capstone project <br>
It is a detailed online resource made to offer engaging and educational representations of disease data on maps of Cavite. For information on the geographic distribution of diseases and their effects on various locations, public health authorities, researchers, and the general public can all benefit from visiting our website.

Tech Stack:<br>
PHP<br>
Bootstrap<br>
Chart.js<br>
Google Map API<br>
XAMPP<br>

Features:<br>
This capstone project has an admin side and a landing page. In admin side of things there are CRUD operations for Admins and Patients. There is also account management and manipulation of datas presenting in line and pie charts. The highlight of the project is the heatmap generated using the Google Map API that displays the distribution of disease in map of Cavite. 

Process:<br>
This capstone project using a pure PHP language. As I create the project, I also started learning the PHP. I can say that I learned everything by doing it. At first I try how the CRUD operations work in PHP then I implemented it one by one in this project. I also use bootstrap for the styling and get a template for me to get started. I modified the template as I see fit while also understanding and learning how the bootstrap works. Next is how I implement the chart.js in my PHP code. At first I struggle to passed data between JS and PHP but after countless of search I managed to do it. Lastly is the heatmap using google map API. I used the same logic as the chart.js since they are both JS to PHP process. Overall it is a good experience specially I don't have prior knowledge on everything I did. I am new to every technology I used in this capstone project.

Learnings:<br>
I learned everything firsthand, from PHP, JS, Chart.js and using Google Map API. It improved my selfstudy techniques and self discipline. I learned that I have the grit and curiosity to study those technologies. My prior self study of Flutter framework also helped me to understand complex logics at the time. It helps me think like on what should I do if I used flutter. Even though it is procedural PHP, flutter help me to think things through. My next goal would be learning PHP in OOP style.

Improvement:<br>
Things could be improved in this capstone project is the structure. As I said it is in procedural PHP, it would be better for it to be in OOP. As I don't have enought time to make it into OOP and I needed to deliver results right away. I will also be better if it is in Laravel Framework since it has all the things needed in this project.
